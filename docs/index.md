# FAQ

## Can I participate if I am not a tatar?

Yes, being tatar is a state of mind.

## Do you hate russians?

No. Russia is home to many brave people opposing ruscism and the current political regime. We simply want to establish different boundaries in how we communicate with ethnic Russians.

## Are you nationalists?

No. The name of the project is only chosen because its two co-founders are tatar. The project welcomes activists from any ethnicity.

## Are you anonymous?

No. In fact, you can trace one of the co-founders using the public repo from where this website is built from. Each of the commits in the repo is also signed with said co-founder's real name and/or my real name is stated in said co-founder's public profile.

We do not intend to hide and act as hypocrites by promoting risky actions without taking on some risks ourselves. 

## Is affiliation with you fully safe?

No. Friends and members of the immediate family of one of the co-founders have been subject to repression and persecution in russia. Do not openly affiliate yourself with this project unless you are fully aware of the risks.

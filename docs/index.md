## Freedom From Fear

The **Freedom From Fear** project is a an aggregator of several different ways one can donate to the Ukrainian Armed Forces without incurring risk of repression or persecution.


### Problem Statement

For many people, donations to the Ukrainian Armed Forces carry a significant perceived risk. This is justified as such donations are considered treason in russia, and treason is currently punishable by up to 25 years in prison. While donations to the Ukrainian Armed Forces are one of the most effective ways to ensure the eventual dissolution of russia, the risks detailed above mean that plenty of possible donations are prevented by fear of possible retribution from the russian government. This is especially true if the donating party has to visit russia or has family members in russia.

### Solution

We offer a metaphorical 'freedom from fear' (hence the project) name by proposing two ways via which the risks detailed above could be bypassed.

* Donating to private individuals rather than donating to Ukrainian military organisations directly is one such bypass. In the case of such donations, the private individual to whom the donation is made takes on 99% of responsibility for the final donation to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In other words, the russian law enforcement apparatus has nearly nothing that they could charge the person who made the original donation, doubly so if the donation was made using any payment system unafiiliated with russia (such as Revolut).
* The use of crypto-currencies is another bypass by retaining the anonymity of the donating party. While there had been cases where the russian law enforcement apparatus has been able to attain the details of the participants of blockchain transactions, such cases were caused by malicious third parties rather than inherent weaknesses in the blockchain technology.

### Methodology and Action Plan

Acting on the solutions proposed above, we outline the following action plan.

Shukhrat Khannanov (thereafter named as SKH), one of the co-founders of the **Tatars Against Ruscism** movement, is hereby obligated to disclose the details of their Revolut account and share their account details on suitable social media and Telegram channels. SKH must state that they are willing to act as the dedicated 'risk-taker' for people who want to donate to the Ukrainian Armed Forces but are fearful of retribution from the russian government. As Revolut does not cooperate with the russian government in any shape or form, payments made to SKH are simply 'gifts' in legal terms. SKH is obligated to transfer such 'gifts' to the Ukrainian Armed Forces listed in the current donations plan (see below).

Kirill Kruszewski (thereafter named as Kirill), one of the activists of the **Tatars Against Ruscism** movement, is hereby obligated to create a Telegram bot (thereafter named as 'bot') that allows users to 'mint' non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the 'background' of their mobile OS, earning a steady passive income or retaining the minted tokens for any other forms of use. The bot shall be distributed by Kirill at no additional charge using suitable social media and messengers. The bot will include a detailed disclaimer listing one or more secure crypto wallets. The disclaimer will also encourage donations to these wallets. 

### Justification

The justification for the above solutions is as follows.

* By disclosing the details of their Revolut account and taking on significant risks, SKH acts as a 'safe proxy', encouraging a sense of security among other donating parties. It is hoped that this sense of security will enable donating parties to act on their intrinsic motivation to financially support the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
* The use of crypto-currencies shall be supported by a particular product (see above) distributed at no extra charge. The product will allow users to earn a small but stable passive income. It is hoped that the sense of gratitude elicited by this will encourage users to financially support the causes that the author of the product is advocating for.

### Limitations

The organisers acknowledge that no donation to the Ukrainian Armed Forces is free of risk given the severity and brutality of the current russian government. Nonetheless, given the resources available to the authors of the project, we believe that the project sufficiently mitigates the risk of persecution for the average person.

# FAQ

## Can I participate if I am not a tatar?

Yes, being tatar is a state of mind.

## Do you hate russians?

No. Russia is home to many brave people opposing ruscism and the current political regime. We simply want to establish different boundaries in how we communicate with ethnic Russians.

## Are you nationalists?

No. The name of the project is only chosen because its two co-founders are tatar. The project welcomes activists from any ethnicity.

## Are you anonymous?

No. In fact, you can trace one of the co-founders using the public repo from where this website is built from. Each of the commits in the repo is also signed with said co-founder's real name and/or my real name is stated in said co-founder's public profile.

We do not intend to hide and act as hypocrites by promoting risky actions without taking on some risks ourselves. 

## Is affiliation with you fully safe?

No. Friends and members of the immediate family of one of the co-founders have been subject to repression and persecution in russia. Do not openly affiliate yourself with this project unless you are fully aware of the risks.
